# project_1 - Food for Thought
Food accessibility, health and food choices were the overarching themes of the Food for Thought project. We looked to analyze how food accessibility and health may play into the choices an indiviual may make regarding food to fit their particular goals. 


## Technologies
All data cleaning, exploration and analysis occurred in jupyter notebooks. Utilizing pandas and matplotlib, the csv files were able to help generate a variety of data points and visualizations that aided in the construction of the PowerPoint presentation.




## Data Clean Up & Exploration 

The data clean up and explorations were as follows:

All datasets were fairly large and required the removal of null and duplicate values for accurate results. In combining related datasets, additional cleaning was required to remove irrevlant items, correct misspelled items or understand where the join may have resulted in inaccuracies. 

Additionally, there were some difficulties in the conversions of various variables. For example, certain nutritional information or numerical data was categorized as an object rather than an integer/float. This required conversions to a string along with removal of extra characters to utilize the data appropriately in pandas. 

Graph formatting required color adjustment and xtick adjustments to achieve readability and usability for the PowerPoint presentation. Please see each respective notebook for further detail regarding data cleaning and exploration based on the datasets used. 


## Data Analysis



## Notebooks 
A split function and for loop were utilized to grab caloric value within an object. The process of creating main and sub-categories also utilzed a similar concept where the split function was used to grab the first work of the ingredient - which was then used to create the main category. 


## Data


Since the recipes and user intreaction datasets were too large, we had to put in a drive and save it locally to run the scripts. Please find the links for the respectve datasets below prior to running the notebooks.
